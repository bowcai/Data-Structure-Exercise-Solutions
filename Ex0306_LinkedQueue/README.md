## Exercise 03.06 - Linked Queue

Implement a queue with circular linked list. 
The list is required to have a head node and a tail pointer, 
but should not have a head pointer.  
Implement enqueuing, dequeuing, emptying the queue and 
determining that the queue is empty.

假设以带头节点的循环链表表示队列，并且只设一个指针指向队尾元素节点（注意不设头指针），
试编写相应的置空队列，判断队列空，入队列，出队列等算法。
